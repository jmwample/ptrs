//!  Generic Handshake for Tor. Extension of Tor circuit creation handshake design.
//!
//! Tor circuit handshakes all implement a one-way-authenticated key
//! exchange, where a client that knows a public "onion key" for a
//! relay sends a "client onionskin" to extend to a relay, and receives a
//! "relay onionskin" in response.  When the handshake is successful,
//! both the client and relay share a set of session keys, and the
//! client knows that nobody _else_ shares those keys unless they
//! relay's private onion key.
//!
//! Currently, this module implements only the "ntor" handshake used
//! for circuits on today's Tor.
